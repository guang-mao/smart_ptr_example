This tutorial talk about smart pointer. here I will use example showing c++ program, if you need the detailed concept, you may want to check out on official website view. 

Following step in your linux terminal:

$git clone https://github.com/guang-mao/smart_ptr_example.git

$cd smart_ptr_example

$chmod +x ./layout       (if you want to run program to show the result, you first change this executable file permission.)
